# Privacy Policy

## PART I: MSNW Subscription Agreement (MSA) f/k/a Michaelnet Primary Subscription Agreement (PSA) a/k/a Michaelnet Subscription Agreement (MSA)

PLEASE READ THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (“SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT”, “AGREEMENT”, OR “TERMS OF USE”) CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING ANY SERVICES OR MEDIA PACKAGES FROM MICHAELNET. THIS AGREEMENT WILL GOVERN YOUR USE OF MICHAELNET'S SERVICES AND MEDIA PACKAGES.

You hereby acknowledge that you agree to this Subscriber Agreement by clicking “I Agree & I also Continue” (or any other industry standard mechanisms during the registration process) and thus ratify your agreement when you purchase any aspect of Michaelnet's services. If you do not agree to this Subscriber Agreement, you should not purchase any of Michaelnet's services or media packages.

Michaelnet may change the Terms and Conditions of this Subscriber Agreement at any time, with or without prior written notice. However, the latest version of our Subscriber Agreement will be posted on our Site at all times; to this end, we strongly advise you to frequently review our Subscription Agreement, especially prior to purchasing any product or services available through our Site.

### 1. MEDIA SUBSCRIPTIONS

#### 1.1: Monthly and Annual subscriptions to Michaelnet media content will be renewed automatically from your pre-approved Payment Method (e.g., credit or debit card; bank account; PayPal; Google Pay; etc.) until cancelled or terminated.

#### 1.2.: You must cancel your membership before it renews in order to avoid billing of the membership fees for the next billing cycle. (see below for more details.)

#### 1.3: Some content will only be available to users for a fixed amount time regardless of whichever subscription plan you have purchased; subject to change by Michaelnet's sole discretion.

#### 1.4: “Subscription & Merch Bundles” may have different initial and re-billing costs.

#### 1.5: We will always provide specific language for each type of media package in the “store”, or wherever such subscription information is listed on our Site, so you are fully aware of what your specific billing policy will be for that particular media package.

### 2. BILLING AND CANCELLATION

#### 2.1: Billing Cycle:Membership fees will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on your “Account” page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose.

#### 2.2: Fees Are Nonrefundable: Absent evidence of fraud or technical error with our Site, your membership fees are considered earned upon receipt and are non-refundable. We may, however, on a case-by-case basis provide a full refund, or other remedy, at our sole discretion.

#### 2.3: Payment Methods:To enjoy Michaelnet media packages and services, you must provide at least one Payment Method. You thus authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account on the contingency that your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fees. You ultimately remain responsible for any uncollected fee(s); thus, if a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration, insufficient funds, or act of God/Nature, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

#### 2.4: Updating Payment Method(s): You can update your Payment Methods by going to the “Account” page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

#### 2.5: Cancellation: You can cancel your Michaelnet membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to our network through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to the “Account” page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click “Billing details” on the “Account” page.

#### 2.6: Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans: We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.

### 3. AGE LIMITATIONS

#### 3.1: Michaelnet's services and media packages are not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or legal guardian. If you are under the age of 18 you are not permitted to register with Michaelnet, purchase any subscriptions, or provide your personal identifiable information (“PII”) unless you have the consent of your parent or legal guardian.

As a general note, please be aware that multiple simultaneous streams, as well as HD and 4K Ultra HD content on other sites, may require higher internet bandwidth.

We may keep your PII only as long as reasonably necessary to provide you with Michaelnet services and other legitimate business purposes such as maintaining the performance of our services, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with any of our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.

We keep some of your PII for as long as you are a user/subscriber of Michaelnet. For example, we keep your account information, media library, purchase history, etc.

Upon your express request, we will immediately delete your personal data such as Name, Payment Method, etc., unless we are legally obligated to maintain or keep such information for various situations such as:

    If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding balance on your account or other unresolved claim or dispute, we will retain the necessary PII until such issue is fully resolved;
    Where we need to retain the PII for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary PII for the period required by any applicable law, statue, or regulation;
    Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our Site and of our users.

### 5: Security of your Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”)

    Michaelnet has instituted security measures on this Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your PII and other information that is under our control. To the best extent possible, specifically, (i) our network and database are highly secure; (ii) only authorized employees have access to contact data; (iii) all employees are educated on our privacy policies; (iv) all employees agree to adhere to our privacy policies as a condition of employment; (v) our network and database are password protected and are behind both a firewall and proxy server to ensure security; (vi) our web security is under on-going scrutiny and review to ensure that it meets the highest standards; and (vii) collected information is never shared with non-interested third parties.

    When using chat rooms and discussion forums on our Site (if they become/are available), we strongly advise you to remember that your communications with other users in 'public' chat rooms and forums are not private. To this end, you should not divulge your PII to anyone (especially credit card, personal home address, phone number, etc.) in a chat room or forum. If you choose to share such information, you do so at your own peril.

    When using chat rooms and discussion forums on our Site (if they become/are available), we strongly advise you to immediately flag or report any and all abusive behavior or language by other users. Michaelnet has a zero tolerance policy for abusive or otherwise threatening language. Moreover, please report or flag anyone who asks you or continues to ask you for your PII because it could be a scam or someone who wishes to cause harm. We take such reports very seriously and will investigate your concerns to the best of our ability in a reasonably timely manner.

    We do not—and never will—sell, rent or lease your personal information to others who are not affiliated with us. We may, however, share certain personal information with companies working on our behalf and affiliated businesses for the legitimate business practices detailed above. In any such cases, however, we require that the companies or entities adhere to privacy standards and policies that are at least as restrictive as those that Michaelnet has in place.

### 6: Your Rights Under This Privacy Policy Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)

Michaelnet strives to keep your PII accurate and up-to-date. Towards this goal we utilize various technology, management processes and policies. As part of our overall data accuracy initiative, we provide you with reasonable access to your PII so you may review and correct your information as necessary. To safeguard your privacy and security, we will verify your identity through various means such as by requiring a password and user ID before granting access to your data.

You can request access to your PII, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate PII we hold about you. You may also request that we delete PII that we hold about you, subject of course to the conditions outlined in Section V above.

When you visit the “Account” portion of our Site, you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Payment Method information, and various related information about your account.

For other requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy practices, or have questions about “Opting Out” of sharing or disclosing certain PII to us or third-parties, please contact our Prophylactic Data Officer/Privacy Office at: michaelnet@michaelnet.biz

We may, however, reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, immoral, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as froid. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
