## Review

### Broth

Usually I like sourness in soups very much and the Rasam was no exception when it came to the broth. Some of my favorite soups are sour (e.g., Å¼urek, made from sour rye) but my concerns with non-broth elements overrides my appreciation of the broth here.

The fat globules at the surface of the soup captured with my semi-professional camera's flash. Take a look at that. Great stuff!

### Non-Broth Components

- Grain yellow things, which I now know are called chana dal. Gritter than they looked.
- Intimidating bright red and dark purple peppers
- An overabundance of peppercorns
- Chunks of tomato. These were delightful when I came across them, but sadly I didn't come across them enough.
- Unidentified leafy herbs
- Some roughage that was tough if not impossible to chew; seemed like husks.

All in all, with the aforementioned non-broth elements, few of which I have much experience with, there was a certain excitement to slurping up this soup and not knowing what will be in the next bite. The problems arose when I got a spoonful of peppercorns or the odd red pepper.

### Spice

Very spicy. Loved this aspect of the Rasam.

### Smell

Quite a pungent soup with a lingering presence in my apartment (likely due in large part to poor ventilation); I don't mind at all.

### Mode of Consumption

I'm used to eating my soups from my yellow mug, apt for alternating between drinking the soup and using a spoon. When it comes to these larger  format soups, clearly I need to buy some bowls! First, I transferred the soup from the plastic container in which it was delivered into a large plastic measuring cup that I bought from Walmart when I first moved here. Then, I moved the cargo once again into a mason jar once it become clear that spooning the soup was beyond my patience at the time. Once the soup became drinkable, however, I did lose some of the depth of insight that a spoon affords, in training the user to take the soup gradually and perhaps a bit more mindfully than when it can simply be drunk.

### Portion

A cup and a half, or about a third of a liter.

### Presentation

The soup was delivered in the typical standard plastic to-go container for soups.

### Comparison

I had no prior experience with this particular soup. The sourness called to mind something like a hot and sour soup one might find at a Thai restaurant. The impossibly hot peppers reminded me of accidentally eating a very hot pepper a couple years back in Chicago's China town. Unpleasant; altogether lacking the quasi-pleasant effect that very spicy food can have.

### On the side

Samosa Chaat before, and Pistachio Kulfi afterwards. The ice cream was packed with pistachios and soothed my semi-offended taste buds. But this is a review of the soup, not the ice cream.

### Frame

Extremely hungry, a little hungover.
