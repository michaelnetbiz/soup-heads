## Review

### Bisque

According to the Oxford English Dictionary [zotpressInText item="{V3U4C5WZ}"], <em>bisque</em> is:

<blockquote>A term for the odds which one [tennis] player gives the other in allowing him to score one point once during the ‘set’ at any time he may elect. Also in Croquet: An extra turn allowed to a weaker player.</blockquote>

There is not a single element of this definition that rings true with my experience of the <em>bisque</em> currently under review. But as an empiricist I will not let this odd definition phase me.

The stuff I have in front of me is rich; it's almost a sauce. I like that. But it's intensely salty. Like everyone, I like salty things, but this soup left me dying for a glass of water.

The taste of the bisque recalls SpaghettiOs, and while I enjoyed SpaghettiOs in my youth I don't believe for a second Campbell's was aiming to emulate them for this "Slow Kettle-Style" line of soups. With the Slow Kettle-Style soups they are clearly appealing to contemporary consumers' increasing demands for the natural/organic/raw/unprocessed/etc. And yet this particular soup tastes so similar to that quintessential processed food. Try again, Campbell's!

### Non-Bisque Components

A smattering of tomato chunks. I would need more tomato chunks to be able to call this soup hearty.

### Spice

more basil plz

### Smell

This soup made sure it was remembered for at least a two or three hours after consumption. After that, no lingering smell.

### Mode of Consumption

Shout out to my pals from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland. This cup doesn't hold much, which ensures slow consumption due to my reluctance to get up for a refill. I drank from the cup, used a spoon, and also used my toast to consume the bisque.

### Portion

I ate the whole thing.

### Presentation

I ordered the soup from Amazon and here's what I got. Some kind of plastic container but opened with a pop-top sort of
arrangement.

### Comparison

My experience with canned tomato soups is limited to Progresso, Amy's, and Campbells' other styles. Amy's offers a
low-sodium tomato soup that would, I'm willing to bet, solve the problems presented on that front by the soup currently
under review.

### On the side

I've always enjoyed putting crackers or dunking bread in my soups. In this case, I made some rye bread toast on my stove and topped it with a bit of salt and pepper.
