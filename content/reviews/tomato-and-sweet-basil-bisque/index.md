## Review

### Bisque

According to the Oxford English Dictionary [zotpressInText item="{V3U4C5WZ}"], <em>bisque</em> is:

<blockquote>A term for the odds which one [tennis] player gives the other in allowing him to score one point once during the 'set' at any time he may elect. Also in Croquet: An extra turn allowed to a weaker player.</blockquote>

There is not a single element of this definition that rings true with my experience of the <em>bisque</em> currently under review. But as an empiricist I will not let this odd definition phase me.

The stuff I have in front of me is rich; it's almost a sauce. I like that. But it's intensely salty. Like everyone, I like salty things, but this soup left me dying for a glass of water.

The taste of the bisque recalls SpaghettiOs, and while I enjoyed SpaghettiOs in my youth I don't believe for a second Campbell's was aiming to emulate them for this "Slow Kettle-Style" line of soups. With the Slow Kettle-Style soups they are clearly appealing to contemporary consumers' increasing demands for the natural/organic/raw/unprocessed/etc. And yet this particular soup tastes so similar to that quintessential processed food. Try again, Campbell's!

### Non-Bisque Components

A smattering of tomato chunks. I would need more tomato chunks to be able to call this soup hearty.

### Spice

more basil please!

### Smell

This soup made sure it was remembered for at least a two or three hours after consumption. After that, no lingering smell.

### Mode of Consumption

Shout out to my pals from Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland! This cup doesn't hold much, which ensures slow consumption due to my reluctance to get up for a refill. I drank from the cup, used a spoon, and also used my toast to consume the bisque.

### Portion

I ate the whole thing.

### Presentation

I ordered the soup from Amazon and here's what I got. Some kind of plastic container but opened with a pop-top sort of arrangement.

### Comparison

My experience with canned tomato soups is limited to Progresso, Amy's, and Campbells' other styles. Amy's offers a low-sodium tomato soup that would, I'm willing to bet, solve the problems presented on that front by the soup currently under review.

### On the side

I've always enjoyed putting crackers or dunking bread in my soups. In this case, I made some rye bread toast on my stove and topped it with a bit of salt and pepper.
